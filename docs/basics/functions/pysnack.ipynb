    "Functions can be a challenging concept in programming, so let's get acquainted using an conceptual example: let's open up a cookie shop.\n",
    "Specifically, chocolate chip cookies üç™.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, we need a [recipe](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-chip-cookies/).\n",
    "The ingredients are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   1 cup salted butter softened\n",
    "-   2 cups granulated sugar\n",
    "-   2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n",
    "-   2 large eggs\n",
    "-   3 cups all-purpose flour\n",
    "-   1 teaspoon baking soda\n",
    "-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n",
    "-   1 teaspoon sea salt\n",
    "-   2 cups chocolate chips (14 oz)\n",
    "\n",
    "with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.\n",
    "    Line three baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\n",
    "2.  In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.\n",
    "    Set aside.\n",
    "3.  Cream together butter and sugars until combined.\n",
    "4.  Beat in eggs and vanilla until light (about 1 minute).\n",
    "5.  Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.\n",
    "6.  Add chocolate chips and mix well.\n",
    "7.  Roll 2-3 Tablespoons (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.\n",
    "8.  Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just barely starting to turn brown.\n",
    "9.  Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.\n",

    "You may be thinking, \"Why is every line indented four spaces?\"\n",
    "Well, in Python, you need to indent lines that are within the function to communicate when it ends.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n",

    "-   2/3 cup cocoa powder\n",
    "-   1/2 cup powdered sugar\n",
    "-   1/2 cup chocolate chips\n",
    "-   3/4 teaspoons sea salt\n",
    "-   2 large eggs\n",
    "-   1/2 cup canola oil\n",
    "-   2 tablespoons water\n",
    "-   1/2 teaspoon vanilla\n",
    "\n",
    "with the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Preheat the oven to 325¬∞F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.\n",
    "2.  In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.\n",
    "3.  In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.\n",
    "4.  Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.\n",
    "5.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the top.\n",
    "6.  Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached.\n",
    "7.  Cool completely before slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that there is a decent amount of overlap between the two recipes!\n",
    "However, our `make_cookies` robot only knows how to make cookies, which is fine if we do not want to expand our business.\n",
    "I could make another function called `make_brownies` and put the instructions there, but this would quickly become a lot of work if I wanted to add other baked goods on the menu like muffins and scones.\n",
    "Ideally, we would have a **modular** framework that can adapt to most of the slight variations between recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the instructions, we have some common actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `oven_operation`: Turning on the oven, taking things in and out.\n",
    "-   `mixing`: Take some number of ingredients, put them in a bowl (that may already have stuff in it), and mix it.\n",

    "  \n",
    "`mix` would need to be able to handle these situations different situations and adapt to the task.\n",

    "def mix(ingredients):\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "mix(ingredients, \"clean\")\n",
    "mix(ingredients, \"filled\")\n",
    "mix(ingredients, \"clean\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Oh, we have not seen that before!\n",
    "I'm not passing a variable into the function, I'm passing the actual data.\n",
    "That is perfectly fine!\n",
    "Remember, when I call a function I am putting my data that gets its own label within the function.\n",
    "In the last function call, the function would have `bowl` that is equal to `\"clean\"` inside of its scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now, what if we can tell the robot to&mdash;unless I explicitly put something in `bowl`&mdash;to grab a clean one from inside its room?\n",
    "We can do that with **default parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mix(ingredients, bowl=None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this does is tell Python that if I do not give you something to put into the `bowl` parameter, then set it equal to `None`.\n",
    "I can also replace this default `None` value with my own during the function call if I would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mix(ingredients, bowl=\"filled\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Default parameters offer flexibility by allowing functions to be called with or without certain arguments, providing reasonable default values when necessary.\n",

    "<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n",
    "    <p class=\"admonition-title\">Caution</p>\n",
    "    <p style=\"padding-top: 1em\">\n",

    "    </p>\n",

    "    We can see at the call site exactly which values we're passing to the function.\n",
