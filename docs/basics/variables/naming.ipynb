    "Here are some guidelines for naming variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Snake case is the most widely used convention for naming variables in Python.\n",
    "    It involves using lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.\n",
    "    For example: `my_variable`, `user_name`, `total_count`.\n",
    "-   Choose variable names that are descriptive and convey the purpose or content of the variable.\n",
    "    This makes the code more self-explanatory.\n",
    "    For instance, use `customer_name` instead of `cn` or `x`.\n",
    "-   Try to avoid single-letter variable names.\n",
    "    Exceptions include common conventions like `i`, `j`, and `k` for some numbers.\n",
    "-   If you have a variable that is meant to be a constant (i.e., its value should never change), use all uppercase letters with underscores separating words.\n",
    "    For example: `MAX_SIZE`, `PI`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is the recommended style guide for Python code.\n",
    "There are some variations, but having everyone stick to a consistent style helps new developers get up to speed quicker.\n",
    "There are some formatters, like [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), that are widely used because the automatically format your code consistently."
