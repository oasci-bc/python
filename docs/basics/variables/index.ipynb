    "In programming languages, variables play a crucial role as they serve as labels for storing and manipulating data.\n",
    "A variable is essentially a symbolic name or identifier associated with a memory location that holds a value.\n",
    "These values can be numbers, characters, strings, or more complex data structures.\n",

    "These are no different than variables in math.\n",
    "If I give you an equation $x + y$ and then tell you $x = 1$ and $y = 3$, you mentally put these numbers in the equation and get $1 + 3$.\n",
    "In fact, that is all valid Python!"
