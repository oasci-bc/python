# Basics

There are a ton of resources to learn the basics of Python and I cannot necessarily write better ones.
Here are some options I recommend&mdash;in decreasing order&mdash;along with what sections will be relevant for this course.

-   [kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/): "Intro to Programming", "Intro to Machine Learning", "Python", and "Pandas" courses.
-   [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
-   [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/): "Learn the Basics" and "Data Science Tutorials".
-   [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python): Everything.
-   [Byte of Python](../external/byte-of-python/): Everything

I am a huge fan of the [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) website; it is my go-to place for learning more about Python.

!!! note "Computers are precise but not intuitive"

    A common misconception is that computers are "smart." In reality, computers are incredibly precise but lack intuition.
    They only execute the exact instructions provided by programmers.
    If you omit a detail or make a simple typo, the computer will encounter an error and stop.
    Remember this as you embark on your programming journey: clarity and precision are key to effective coding.
