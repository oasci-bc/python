    "## 4.1  The turtle module\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether you have the turtle module, open the Python interpreter and type\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import turtle\n",
    "bob = turtle.Turtle()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it should create a new window with small arrow that represents the turtle.\n",
    "Close the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `mypolygon.py` and type in the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "import turtle\n",
    "bob = turtle.Turtle()\n",
    "print(bob)\n",
    "turtle.mainloop()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `turtle` module (with a lowercase ’t’) provides a function called `Turtle` (with an uppercase ’T’) that creates a `Turtle` object, which we assign to a variable named bob. Printing bob displays something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<turtle.Turtle object at 0xb7bfbf4c>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that `bob` refers to an object with type `Turtle` as defined in module `turtle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mainloop` tells the window to wait for the user to do something, although in this case there’s not much for the user to do except close the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create a `Turtle`, you can call a method to move it around the window.\n",
    "A method is similar to a function, but it uses slightly different syntax.\n",
    "For example, to move the turtle forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bob.fd(100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The method, `fd`, is associated with the turtle object we’re calling `bob`.\n",
    "Calling a method is like making a request: you are asking `bob` to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument of fd is a distance in pixels, so the actual size depends on your display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods you can call on a Turtle are `bk` to move backward, `lt` for left turn, and `rt` right turn.\n",
    "The argument for `lt` and `rt` is an angle in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves a trail when it moves.\n",
    "The methods `pu` and `pd` stand for “pen up” and “pen down”.\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program (after creating bob and before calling `mainloop`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bob.fd(100)\n",
    "bob.lt(90)\n",
    "bob.fd(100)\n",
    "```\n",

    "The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so don’t look until you have finished (or at least tried).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called `square` that takes a parameter named `t`, which is a turtle.\n",
    "    It should use the turtle to draw a square.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Write a function call that passes `bob` as an argument to `square`, and then run the program again.\n",
    "2. Add another parameter, named `length`, to `square`.\n",
    "    Modify the body so `length` of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument.\n",
    "    Run the program again.\n",
    "    Test your program with a range of values for `length`.\n",
    "3. Make a copy of `square` and change the name to `polygon`.\n",
    "    Add another parameter named `n` and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.\n",
    "4. Write a function called `circle` that takes a turtle, `t`, and radius, `r`, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling `polygon` with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of `r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that `length * n = circumference`.\n",
    "5. Make a more general version of `circle` called `arc` that takes an additional parameter angle, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. `angle` is in units of degrees, so when `angle=360`, `arc` should draw a complete circle. "

    "## 4.4  Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def square(t):\n",
    "    for i in range(4):\n",

    "The innermost statements, `fd` and `lt` are indented twice to show that they are inside the for loop, which is inside the function definition.\n",
    "The next line, `square(bob)`, is flush with the left margin, which indicates the end of both the for loop and the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function, `t` refers to the same turtle bob, so `t.lt(90)` has the same effect as `bob.lt(90)`.\n",
    "In that case, why not call the parameter `bob`?\n",
    "The idea is that t can be any turtle, not just `bob`, so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to `square`:\n",

    "\n",
    "When a function has more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in.\n",
    "In that case it is often a good idea to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)\n",

    "These are called keyword arguments because they include the parameter names as “keywords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like `while` and `def`).\n",

    "One limitation of this solution is that `n` is a constant, which means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments.\n",
    "One solution would be to generalize the function by taking n as a parameter.\n",
    "This would give the user (whoever calls `circle`) more control, but the interface would be less clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters?\n",

    "Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of `n` depending on `circumference`:\n",

    "\n",

    "    arc(t, r, 360)\n",
