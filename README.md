Welcome to **Python Breadcrumbs**, a centralized hub for open educational resources dedicated to learning scientific Python.
Whether you're learning Python for the first time or refreshing your data analysis, modeling, or simulation skills, these resources are designed to empower you by making scientific computing accessible and intuitive.

## What is Breadcrumbs?

Education stands as a pivotal force in socioeconomic mobility.
Yet, generational barriers outside of an individual's influence hinder a person's access to educational opportunities.
Breadcrumbs represents [OASCI's](https://www.oasci.org/) initiative to fundamentally transform access to educational materials, embodying the spirit of discovery and the sharing of knowledge fragments that have traditionally been exclusive to select groups.
Breadcrumb websites are freely accessible resources, and we encourage contributions, improvements, and adaptations so long as they abide by the terms outlined in the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.
